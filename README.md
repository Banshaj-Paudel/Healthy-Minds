## **Healthy Minds**
 
### Healthy minds is an *AI powered project* which is used to *detect Alzheimer's Disease(AD).* It uses MRI scan results to identify AD. Our project *uses Tensorflow and Keras CNN for training the neural network* to detect early-stage Alzheimer's. The model returns data through API, for which we have used FastAPI. The API data is further processed with *ExpressJS in the back-end* whereas we have used *ReactJS for the the dashboard.*
 
## **Use of IPFS and .NET**
 
### IPFS powers the Distributed Web. It's a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge by making the web upgradeable, resilient, and more open. We have used the IPFS protocol to store the data of MRI Scans. The data is stored in the IPFS network and is accessible through the IPFS protocol. The use of IPFS ensures the data is secure and not accessible by anyone else.
 
### Here .NET is used to interact with the IPFS file system.
 
## **Our mission**
 
### The main goal of our project is "Leading towards a healthier tomorrow".
